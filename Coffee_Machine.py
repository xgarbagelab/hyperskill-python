# # Write your code here
"""
Objectives
Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested
persons until the shutdown signal is given.
Introduce two new options: "remaining" and "exit".

Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee.
If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee,
the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€”
if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind,
they should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.
Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
> remaining

The coffee machine has:
400 of water
540 of milk
120 of coffee beans
9 of disposable cups
$550 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
> buy

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
> 2
I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
> remaining

The coffee machine has:
50 of water
465 of milk
100 of coffee beans
8 of disposable cups
$557 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
> buy

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
> 2
Sorry, not enough water!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
> fill

Write how many ml of water do you want to add:
> 1000
Write how many ml of milk do you want to add:
> 0
Write how many grams of coffee beans do you want to add:
> 0
Write how many disposable cups of coffee do you want to add:
> 0

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):

The coffee machine has:
700 of water
390 of milk
80 of coffee beans
